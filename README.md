Real-Time Face Emotion Detection using DeepFace & OpenCV
Face Emotion Detection is a computer vision–based project that uses DeepFace and OpenCV to recognize human emotions from facial expressions. The system captures live video from a webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascade, analyzes emotions using a deep learning model, and visually displays the dominant emotion on the screen. This project is designed for learning and experimentation in emotion recognition, human–computer interaction, and AI-based applications.
A real-time face emotion detection system using DeepFace and OpenCV that detects a person’s dominant facial emotion from a live webcam feed and displays it on the screen.
This project does not include voice output and focuses only on visual emotion detection.
